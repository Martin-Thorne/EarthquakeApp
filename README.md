Earthquake App
=====================

This app is being created as a way for me to practice programming for Android. This project takes data from earthquake.usgs.gov and 
displays a map which shows recent earthquakes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Android CV V1.0.1 is completed. The release consists of the following:

* Display a map with pins to show the recent earthquakes
* When markers are clicked displays information on earthquake.
* When information is clicked opens browser to the relevant earthquakes information page.
